# Doodle-Jump

## Instructions: 
An old game where the player's goal is to jump on as many platforms as possible.
The buttons are the arrows: left, right and down on the keyboard.
The player always jumps when it comes to a new platform, the arrows direct the player according to the user's wishes. When you press right, the player moves to the right, when you press left the player moves left and when you press up it cancels the movement to the right or left.
Each platform on which the player jumps is another point to score.
If the player fell (did not reach the bottom platform) the game is over and the result is displayed on the screen.
